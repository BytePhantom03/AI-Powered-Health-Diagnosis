            <p>
              This AI-powered health diagnosis system leverages machine learning
              to analyze user-reported symptoms and provide potential disease
              predictions. By offering descriptions, precautions, medications,
              diet recommendations, and workout suggestions, the system aims to
              enhance healthcare accessibility and promote early intervention.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">How It Works</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Input Symptoms:</strong> Users enter or speak their
                symptoms into the system.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI Diagnosis:</strong> Our trained model analyzes the
                symptoms and predicts a possible disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Detailed Report:</strong> The system presents a
                description, suggested precautions, medication advice, and
                healthy lifestyle tips.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Technologies Used</h4>
            <p>
              The application is built using Python (Flask), HTML/CSS,
              Bootstrap, and integrates AI/ML models trained on healthcare
              datasets. It is designed to be simple, fast, and informative for
              everyday users.
            </p>
